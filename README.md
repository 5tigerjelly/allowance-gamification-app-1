A gamified way for children to accomplish tasks

## Mission Statement
Simple is Fun


## Problem Statement
As parents get busy and household tasks begin piling up, there is the problem of who completes what tasks. Often times parents assign tasks to their kids. The problem is created when children are lackadaisical and have little motivation to complete these tasks. With fixed allowances, this poses a problem with task complexity. For example, if a child receives an already set allowance, tasks that are more difficult to complete get neglected.
