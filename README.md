# allowance-gamification-app
A gamified way for children to accomplish tasks

## Problem Statement
In households, parents give a set amount of allowance at a set interval as a recurring payment. The allowance is not tied to the performance of the child's activities whats so ever.

## Our Solution
Our solution is to take a gamified approach to the rather dull experience of doing household chores. The parent will be able to create a set of tasks, which once the child finishes the tasks will be awarded the agreed upon amount. This is a great way to teach children about how jobs work in the real world, trading goods and services in return for money.

## Types of Users
### Parents

### Children


## Features
* Parents able to set tasks
* Children able to propose tasks
* Parents able to pay Children

## Technology
The plan is to build this into a mobile application but also support web interfaces later. The reasoning behind going mobile first is because most of the interaction will be on through the mobile platform.

## Limitations
Unfortunately, it is currently impossible to implement any payment transfer like venmo or toss which does not have any public facing APIs
